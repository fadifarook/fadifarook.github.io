Hello there! I am a graduate student at Cornell, currently working with <a href="https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/rivera/">Professor Nicholas Rivera</a> on developing squeezed light sources. I think lasers and laser-matter interactions are pretty cool.

I love tech, horror, sci-fi and talking to people. If you're an aspiring physicist in highschool or just wanna chat about science, hit me up!

You can find my CV <a href="/assets/pdf/{{ page.cv_pdf | relative_url }}">here</a>.
