I worked with <a href="https://www.uwindsor.ca/people/thammond/profiles/thammond">Professor T.J Hammond</a>, where I simulated various nonlinear optics processes. I modelled the Raman effect in particular, and compared pulse propagation equations in different media to balance accuracy and computation time. I presented posters at Photonics Online Meetup 2023 and <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1316311/contributions/5867454/">CAP Congress 2024</a>.

I worked with Dr. Carolyn Sealfon, where I and a couple of colleagues implemented machine learning algorithms to quickly group student feedback in large classes. We were able to identify common points of confusion among first year physics students, and extract the most useful ones. We presented this poster at the UofT ROP Poster Fair 2023.
